Python Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This repository contains a collection of Python programs that demonstrate basic data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and NumPy. The project includes simple examples such as line graphs, bar charts, histograms, and subplots. It is designed for beginners, students, and anyone looking to understand how to create visual representations of data using Python.

Features Included

Line graph for values from 0 to 10

Vertical bar chart showing product sales

A 2×2 grid of subplots with different plot types

Histogram generated from 200 normally distributed random values

Custom colors and styling applied to each plot

Clear and readable code for easy learning
